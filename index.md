I am a PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.ou.edu/) at [The University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu/web/) (OU). Currently, I am working on mathematical billiards under the supervision of [Pengfei Zhang](https://math.ou.edu/~pzhang/). My insterests also include mathematical modeling, machine learning, and data science. I've been at OU since 2016, having completed my BS and MA in mathematics. Previously, I was at Oklahoma City Community College (OCCC) from 2014-2015.

I'm originally from [Mexico City](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/john-coletti-mexico-city) but also lived in Los Angeles from 1999-2009.
