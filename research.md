My current research is on chaotic billiards in Finsler and Riemannian geometries. I will update this page as I begin to obtain results. 

In the summer of 2018 I was very fortunate to be a part of the [San Diego State University Mathematics Research Experience for Undergraduates](http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/math-reu/). Under the supervision of [Naveen K. Vaidya](https://nvaidya.sdsu.edu/) we developed mathematical models that link within-host and between-host HIV dynamics. We did so by measuring the effects HIV-specific antibodies have on viral load and how they affect the probability of HIV transmission. You can read our results [here](https://carlos91016.github.io/HIV.pdf).
